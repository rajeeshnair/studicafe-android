=================
StudiCafe is an app that was dreamed up by a team of high school girls as part of the nonprofit Technovation program. Technovation is the largest and longest-running global competition for girls in technology.

About StudiCafe: This app helps students study for AP science exams through a virtual "coffee shop" interface. Users can take quizzes and practice with flashcards to hone their skills in chemistry, biology, physics and environmental science. All the graphics and back-end are finished, but we need help with the front end-- creating an architecture for the screens and piecing it all together.

To take a look at the design for the screens see: https://github.com/stargaret/studicafe-android/blob/master/graphic_assets_from_Tri/StudiCafe%20Layout.png
